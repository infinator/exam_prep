## Overview of C
***

### Some Facts
* Developed by Dennis Ritchie.
* C is a structured programming language.
* C supports functions that enables easy maintainability of code, by breaking large file into smaller modules.
* It is a low-level language.

### Header Files

* The files that are specified in the include section is called as header file.
* These are pre-compiled files that has some functions defined in them.
* We can call those program in our program by suppluing parameters
* Header file is given an extension <code>.h</code>
* C source file is given an extension <code>.c</code>

### Main Functions

* It is the entry point of the program.
* It is a compulsory for any C program.

## Data Types
***

1. Primitive data types
    * int    - integer type
    * float  - floating point type
    * double - provides double precision than float
    * char   - character type

2. Aggregate data types
    * arrays

3. User defined data types
    * stucts - collection of variables (can be of different types) under a single name
    * enum   - an enumeration type that consists of integral constants
