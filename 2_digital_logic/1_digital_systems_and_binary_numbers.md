## Digital Systems
***

One characteristic of digital systems is their ability to represent and manipulate discrete elements of information. Any set that is restricted to a finite number of elements contains discrete information.

Discrete elements of information are represented in a digital system by physical quantities called signals. Electrical signals such as voltages and currents are the most common. Electronic devices called transistors predominate in the circuitry that implements these signals.

This signals in most present-day electronic digital systems use just two discrete values. Binary - 0, 1. Discrete elements of information are represented with groups of bits called binary codes.
